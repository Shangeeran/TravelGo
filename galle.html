														The Galle Fort, or Dutch Fort as it is also known, is a fortification first built by the Portugese on the Southwestern coast of Sri Lanka. The initial fortifications, which were built in the late 16th century, were quite basic. However the fort underwent extensive modifications in the 17th century by the Dutch, making it one of the most important archeological, architectural and historic monuments to illutrate the European influence in South East Asia between the 16th and 19th centuries. According to a statement by UNESCO the site was recognized as a World Heritage Site for its unique exposition of an urban ensemble which illustrates the interaction of European architecture and South Asian traditions from the 16th to the 19th centuries which is the criteterion number four for such recognition.

Beach bums can catch some rays at a quieter beach such as Passekudah Bay, there’s SCUBA diving for all you adventure enthusiasts at Hikkaduwa and party people can make themselves at home on the dancefloors of lively Unawatuna beach. Sandy shores, beautiful views and sumptuous seafood are guaranteed at all of our recommended beaches – and don’t forget to Instagram a sunset to make all your friends jealous.Unawatuna beach draws both local and foreign visitors who have come to love this paradise isle profoundly, as well as the newbies. Unawatuna brings to life incalculable resorts, hotels, restaurants and small kiosks selling various goodies from seafood to clothing. Although most Galle town beaches on the one hand lure visitors through its irresistible magnetism of  sun, sea, sand and relaxation, Unawatuna beach is all those and also an ideal place to take a dip in the ocean or indulge in some waters sports with family. Take the Southern Expressway from Colombo for a quick beach getaway or even a spot of sea turtle watching.

													The ground was built in 1876 as a race course. There was no permanent pavilion until 1892, when a ‘grand stand’ was built according to a suggestion of Mr. P A Templer, the then Secretary of the Galle Municipal Council. Eventually the racing ceased and the ground was used for cricket matches more than races. In 1927, the ground was officially declared as a cricket stadium.The ground hosted its first first-class match on 29 February 1984. A turf wicket was introduced to the stadium in 1945 under the guidance of Mr. Dhanapala Lorensu Hewa who was then secretary of the Galle Cricket Ground. The assistance of the Colombo Cricket Club was also taken for this.The ground was later upgraded to international cricket standards, and became the seventh international cricket stadium in Sri Lanka able to host Test matches. The first test match was played on the ground on 3 June 1998. It was played between Sri Lanka and New Zealand, resulting in a win for Sri Lanka by an innings and 16 runs. The first ODI match was scheduled to be held on 25 June 1998 between India and Sri Lanka, but was abandoned due to the ground being waterlogged from overnight rain and heavy raining in the morning.On 26 December, the ground was devastated by the tsunami resulting from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.[4] Most of the buildings in the stadium were damaged, and the ground was damaged substantially. In the weeks that followed, the stadium became a temporary shelter for hundreds of people displaced from the tsunami. A temporary camp and a helipad were constructed there in order to assist the survivors.

														Galle is beautiful city seeped in centuries of history. The remains of this history can still be seen everywhere from its cobblestoned streets, to the historic monuments, to the many still functional structures such as the Galle Lighthouse.The Galle Lighthouse, or Pointe de Galle Light as it was also known, was the very first light station to be built in Sri Lanka. Dating back to 1848; the lighthouse was built by the British to ensure the safe arrival of their ships at the Galle harbour. This original structure stood 24.5 m tall (80 feet) and was located at a site approximately 100 feet from the current lighthouse. Its light was made with a prism lens of glass, which floated in a bath of mercury (to reduce friction); and was powered by a weight driven machine.This lighthouse was destroyed in 1934.The current lighthouse structure was built in 1939; erected within the walls of the ancient Galle Fort with a height of 26.5m (87 feet). The lightstation stands at a strategic location at the southern end of the promontory; built approximately 6m above the road level on the ramparts of the Fort, at a place known as the Point Utrecht Bastion . This affords it an undisturbed view across the seascape; and allowing any incoming ships to see its light.The Galle Lighthouse is currently operated and managed by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. The lights work through a computerized system which allows the foremost light to switch on every night and switch off in the morning. Visitors are not allowed to climb the lighthouse.
