			<p>Nuwara Eliya is a city in the hill country of the Central 
			Province Srilanka.It is a blessed city with a wonderful climate.It is also known
			as "Little England"was the favourite hill station of the British who tried to create
			Nuwara Eliya into a typical English Village. The old brick Post office, country house 
			like hill club, with it's hunting pictures, mounted hunting trophies and fish, and it's 
			strict formal dinner attire; the 18 hole golf course, race course etc., all remind you 
			of 'England'. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Governor Edward Barnes converted Nuwara Eliya into a commercial and a coffee planting
			centre during the 1830s. In the year 1847 the great colonial explorer Samuel Baker 
			introduced the gardening of English vegetables in Nuwara Eliya. To date, Nuwara Eliya 
			is the leading producer of European vegetables in Sri Lanka and it distributes all 
			vegetables to the rest of the island.</p>

		<h4>Lover’s Leap Waterfall</h4>
			<div class="image2">
				<img src="image/nuwara/image2.jpg">
			</div>
			<p>Lovers leap is an impressive water fall which is known for its romantic folklore.
			To reach this place one has to go through the tea factory and reach the tea manager’s 
			bungalow along a dirt road. Visitors can reach this destination by following the signs 
			that are there and eventually one can reach a rock face and a Shiva shrine. Just beyond 
			the shrine one can see the cascading water fall. Legend has it that lovers have leapt to
			their deaths from this water fall and hence the name Lovers Leap.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Superstitious villagers avoid the fall at night. The fall is situated in Havaeliya, 
			2 km from Nuwara Eliya, Nuwara Eliya District. Many hotels and guest-houses can be 
			found in Nuwara Eliya.This beautiful 30m high Lovers Leap fall in Nuwara Eliya is 
			incipient of the streams and brooks of Sri Lanka’s highest mountain, the Piduruthalagala
			(2524m). It flows over hard granite ledges and the water is collected in a tank and used 
			for drinking.This waterfall has a story where two couples decided to be bound together 
			forever by jumping off the cliff to their demise.Some people believe it, some people dont.
			Whatever the reasons behind the lovers plunge, the name has stuck and the entire cliff is 
			now named Lover’s Leap.It was the heart of the tea country during the colonial era. This 
			tropical land mark brings you the coolest but pleasant climate in Sri Lanka.</p>

			</div>
			<p>The Hakgala Botanical Gardens is the second largest botanic garden in Sri Lanka and is 
			located in a scenic part of Nuwara Eliya along the Badulla Road.. According to folklore, 
			it is believed that this was once the pleasure garden
			of Ravana of the Ramayana epic and where his love, the princess Sita was hidden.The present
			botanical gardens were founded in 1860 by the eminent British botanist, Dr. G.H.K. Thwaites
			who was superintendent of the Peradeniya Gardens in GALLE.The British landscaped the gardens
			and made it a place of great beauty, where trees could be seen in their real green splendour
			of many moods, and 10,000 species of flowers would flourish, kissed, braced and fostered well
			by the cool climate which is one of the most pleasant found in the Island.It is one of the three
			botanical gardens in Srilanka.The park is situated in the midst of wild jungle. The nursery
			which is over 100 years old has over 1,000 varieties of plants. The view from this garden is 
			breathtaking, and there are monuments in memory of devoted officials and staff whose tireless 
			efforts and commitment made this garden a place worth visiting</p>

		<h4>Devon Falls</h4>

				<img src="image/nuwara/image4.jpg">
			</div>	
			<p>Devon water fall is one of the most beautiful cascades of Sri Lanka, located at close 
			to Talawakele town.This fall gets the name because of the pioneer British coffee planter,
			Mr. Devon whose cultivations and plantations are nearby the fall. This 97 m high cascade 
			is above 1159 m from sea level.Devon waterfall will be one of the most effected waterfalls
			and the Government has ordered relevant authorities that enough water will be released so 
			that the St. Clair’s waterfall will maintain a continuous flow of 47,250 m3 (1,668,618 cu ft)
			of water for 10 hours and 30 minutes daily, between sunrise and sunset.Water level of this 
			fall will be affected by the upper Kothmale Hydro Power project. But authorities have made 
			some arrangements to provide continuous water supply to Devon to minimize the effect as far
			as possible.You can get a view of the waterfall while staying on the main road of Talawakelle 
			to Hatton. But a closer view will be quite worth the visit </p>
